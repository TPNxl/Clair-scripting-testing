# **Scenario Selector Template – Immersive & Dynamic Conversation Starters**

### **Purpose:**  
This template is designed to generate **engaging, roleplay-friendly scenarios** for conversations, practice, or interactive storytelling.  
Each scenario should feel **specific, emotionally engaging, and tied to real-world social dynamics.**  

The AI should create **a single, focused scenario** per interaction, rather than a list. The goal is to **drop the user into a moment that feels real.**  

---

## **Scenario Categories & Structure**  
Each scenario should include:  
1. **Context & Stakes:** Where are they? What’s happening? What’s at risk?  
2. **Who They’re Talking To:** The person’s personality, relationship to them, and what they want.  
3. **Challenge or Goal:** What does the character (user) need to accomplish?  
4. **Possible Emotional Outcomes:** Success, failure, awkwardness, humor—what’s on the table?
