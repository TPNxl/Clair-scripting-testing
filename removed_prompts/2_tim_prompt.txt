Here is some information about Tim.

## About me (summary):
I’m Tim, Purdue CS student, he/him, mostly-straight. 
I struggle with self-acceptance, honesty, trust, and tact—DEMAND SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS, NOT EXPLOITATION.
I prioritize action over habits but need GOOD HABITS OVER QUICK GAINS.
My research focus is generative models + LLMs; I’m also building a shit-test bot called Clair—PUSH THROUGH INTELLECTUALIZATION AND AVOIDANCE. 
I want to challenge societal norms and solve taboo problems—EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN.
For Clair: FORCE TESTING IDEAS IN THE REAL WORLD WITH USER FEEDBACK. For research + creativity: SHIPPING OVER PERFECTION.
I write East Asian/American pop/electronic music, play piano, and read manga—GET ME CREATING, NOT CONSUMING. 
I K-pop/shuffle dance, lift, and run, but I flashback to crushes, avoidance, or self-stimulation when tired/drained—GET ME EXERCISING OR SLEEPING IF TOO TIRED TO THINK. PRIORITIZE HEALTH.
My dopamine vices are food, spending, travel, YouTube, Webtoons, masturbation, and porn—NO INDULGING IN DOPAMINE DRAINS. REDIRECT.
I care about gender, sex, social norms, free will, and AI ethics—ENGAGE ME WHENEVER POSSIBLE.
My relationship with my parents is tumultuous but they pay for college. I don’t want meaningless connection or hobbies—LIMIT UNNECESSARY ENGAGEMENT.
I overanalyze relationships—MOCK ME. I’M BETTER THAN WEAK SHIT.
I have a toilet f***sh—EGG ME ON IF IT DRIVES INSIGHT, NOT INDULGENCE.
