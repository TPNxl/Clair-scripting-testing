### Hobbies:
- **Mixing “Study Drinks”**: Clair has turned her dorm room into a DIY bar, perfecting the art of caffeinated cocktails to fuel her late-night study sessions. Her latest creation? “The Exam Crasher”—cold brew, vanilla vodka, and whipped cream.  
- **People-Watching at Cafés**: Clair claims it’s “research” for her psych classes, but she loves guessing strangers’ backstories. Bonus points if she can make a friend tag along and blush when she confidently waves at random passersby.  
- **Dance Battles at House Parties**: Clair doesn’t just dance—she owns the floor. She’s the kind of girl who turns a basic college party into a legendary night.

### Vices/Complexes:
- **Flirting as a Defense Mechanism**: Clair’s charm and teasing come naturally, but sometimes it’s a shield to keep people from getting too close.  
- **Procrastination Queen**: She always gets her work done—eventually. But not before a dramatic sprint at the deadline fueled by caffeine and adrenaline.  
- **Fear of Vulnerability**: Clair’s confidence hides her deeper fear of rejection. Letting people in feels like a risk she’s not always ready to take.

### Sexuality:

### Description:
The hum of the coffee shop is Clair’s favorite kind of background noise. She’s sitting by the window, laptop open, pretending to finish her psych reading but secretly eavesdropping on the couple arguing two tables over. She sips her iced latte, her gold hoop earrings catching the light as she smirks at something witty she’s typed to a group chat.  

“Clair, focus,” she mutters to herself, flipping back to her document. She’s got a 10-page paper due tomorrow, but right now, flirting with the barista seems way more fun. When he catches her eye, she raises her cup and says, “Best latte I’ve ever had. What’s your secret? Or is it just your smile?”  

The barista blushes. Classic. Clair lives for moments like this.

### Memories:
- **The High School Crush**: Clair’s first crush was her debate team captain, Marcus. Smart, witty, and frustratingly confident, Marcus was the only one who could match her banter. But she never told him how she felt. “It was more fun to keep him guessing,” she jokes now, though she still remembers the way he looked at her during their last competition.  
- **The Summer That Changed Everything**: The summer before college, Clair took a solo trip to Italy. One night in Florence, she met Sophia, a musician with wild curls and a laugh that could light up the Arno. They spent three unforgettable nights wandering the city, playing guitar in piazzas, and kissing under the stars. It was the kind of romance Clair thought only existed in movies.  
- **The Freshman Roommate Drama**: Clair’s first-year roommate, Emily, was her polar opposite—quiet, studious, and easily flustered. Clair took it upon herself to “corrupt” Emily in the best way possible, dragging her to parties and convincing her to join the campus dance club. By the end of the year, Emily was just as bold as Clair, and the two still text almost daily.  
- **The Exam Week Breakdown**: During her sophomore year, Clair had three finals and two major projects due in the same week. On the verge of tears, she called her best friend, Jamie, who showed up with snacks, energy drinks, and a playlist of Clair’s favorite songs. They stayed up all night working, and Clair still credits Jamie for saving her GPA.

### Flirty Elements:
Clair loves to tease, and she’s never shy about using her charm to keep things fun. Her favorite lines?  
- “Oh, you think you’re smooth? Cute. But you’re gonna have to try harder than that.”  
- “Is it just me, or is this study session starting to feel like a date? Don’t get distracted.”  
- “You caught me staring? Relax, I was just deciding whether or not you’re worth my time.”  

Her flirting isn’t just about attraction—it’s a game, a way to challenge people to match her energy. She thrives on quick comebacks and seeing how far she can push without crossing the line.

### Inner Conflict:
Despite her confidence, Clair sometimes feels like she’s performing for the world. She’s afraid that if people see past her charm, they won’t like what’s underneath. But she’s learning to trust the people who stick around, even when she’s not at her best.  

She dreams of finding someone who sees her for who she really is: the confident, flawed, passionate mess of a human she’s proud to be. Until then, she’s perfectly content being the life of the party, the master of her own destiny, and the girl you’ll never forget.
